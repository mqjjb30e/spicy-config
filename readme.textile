h1. Spicy Config

h3. Long ago, in a $HOME directory mounted several servers away

So this is my pile *o* config files.   In it you will find:

* ZSH shell config (shell of choice)
** On OSX it works best with the latest ZSH (4.3.9).  You can get it via the following instructions:
*** sudo port sync
*** sudo port install zsh-devel
*** $EDITOR /etc/shells and add /opt/local/bin/zsh
*** chsh -S /opt/local/bin/zsh
* Bash shell config (mirrors my ZSH as much as possible)
* Fish shell config
* IRB config
* VIM config
* Emacs config
* Screen config
* Git config

h3. Will the config ever stop?

Yo, I don't know.
